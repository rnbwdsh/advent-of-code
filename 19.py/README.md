# Advent of code 2019 repo

This is my advent of code 2019 repo solved purely in python. 

Every file is a standalone to track the progress, and may contain different versions of the intcode-interpreter.

This code is optimized for readability, so it should conform to the <80 signs/line standard.

Requiremments:
* numpy (for fast maths)
* networkx (for graphs)
* scipy (for optimizing day14)
* aocd (for reading inputs and submitting)
* builtin: collections, functools, itertools, copy, math, cmath, re, time
* optional for visualization: PIL, IPython.display, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot
